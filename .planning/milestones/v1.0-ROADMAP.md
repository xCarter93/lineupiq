# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 30

## Overview

Build a fantasy football prediction app from the ground up: establish a Python/Next.js monorepo, create a robust data pipeline from nflreadpy, engineer high-signal features, train ML models that predict individual player stats, expose predictions via API, store app state in Convex, and deliver a matchup simulation UI.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Establish monorepo with Python ML backend and Next.js frontend, all tooling configured
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- [x] 01-02: Python backend setup with uv
- [x] 01-03: Next.js frontend with Shadcn preset

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline
**Goal**: Fetch and store historical NFL data from nflreadpy (1999-2025)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: nflreadpy integration and data fetching scripts
- [x] 02-02: Raw data storage structure and caching

### Phase 3: Data Processing
**Goal**: Clean, transform, and normalize raw NFL data for ML consumption
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Data cleaning and validation
- [x] 03-02: Player/team ID normalization
- [x] 03-03: Weekly stat aggregations

### Phase 4: Feature Engineering
**Goal**: Create ML-ready features: rolling stats, opponent strength, weather factors
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Rolling window stats (3-week lookback)
- [x] 04-02: Opponent defensive strength metrics
- [x] 04-03: Feature pipeline orchestrator

### Phase 5: Model Development
**Goal**: Build and train ML models for stat prediction (passing/rushing/receiving)
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Training pipeline infrastructure
- [x] 05-02: QB passing stat models
- [x] 05-03: RB rushing stat models
- [x] 05-04: WR/TE receiving stat models

### Phase 6: Model Evaluation
**Goal**: Validate model accuracy, analyze feature importance, prevent overfitting
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Model evaluation infrastructure (metrics, holdout validation)
- [x] 06-02: Feature importance analysis
- [x] 06-03: Overfitting detection and correction

### Phase 7: Prediction API
**Goal**: Python API endpoints for inference with prediction caching
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: FastAPI setup and model loading
- [x] 07-02: Prediction endpoints by position
- [x] 07-03: Response caching layer

### Phase 8: Convex Backend
**Goal**: Convex schema for scoring configs, cached predictions, app state
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Convex schema and setup
- [x] 08-02: Scoring configuration CRUD
- [x] 08-03: Prediction storage and retrieval

### Phase 9: Matchup UI
**Goal**: Frontend for selecting players, opponents, and viewing projected stats
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Player selection component
- [x] 09-02: Opponent/matchup selection
- [x] 09-03: Stat projection display

### Phase 10: Integration & Polish
**Goal**: End-to-end flow working, error handling, UX polish
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Homepage and navigation
- [x] 10-02: Error handling and edge cases
- [x] 10-03: UX refinements

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Predict individual stats, not fantasy points (more accurate, allows custom scoring)
- Skill positions first (QB/RB/WR/TE) — K/DEF deferred
- XGBoost with Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- 6 seasons training data (2019-2024) for robust sample sizes
- SHA-256 hash for prediction cache keys
- Greptile-inspired design aesthetic (warm cream background, white cards)
- CORS middleware for localhost frontend-to-API communication

**Issues Resolved:**
- Model overfitting controlled with 1.3 ratio threshold
- API timeout handling with 10-second AbortController
- Loading states and empty states for better UX

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant — clean MVP implementation
