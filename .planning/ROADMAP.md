# Roadmap: LineupIQ

## Overview

Build a fantasy football prediction app from the ground up: establish a Python/Next.js monorepo, create a robust data pipeline from nflreadpy, engineer high-signal features, train ML models that predict individual player stats, expose predictions via API, store app state in Convex, and deliver a matchup simulation UI. Each phase builds on the previous, prioritizing model accuracy over UI polish.

## Milestones

- ✅ **[v1.0 MVP](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md)** — Phases 1-10 (shipped 2026-01-15)
